<p>For Debian maintainer, there can be 4 approaches for maintaining git repository
with <code>dgit</code>.  Let me get all key points of manpages.</p>

<p>Here, the maintainer column indicates relationship of the maintainer to the upstream development.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s copy key parts of manpages.</p>

<h2 id="dgit-maint-native-7">dgit-maint-native(7)</h2>

<p>This document describes elements of a workflow for using dgit to
maintain a Debian package that uses one of the native source formats
(&ldquo;1.0&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;3.0 (native)&rdquo;).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We expect that your git history is fast-forwarding.</p></li>

<li><p>You should be prepared to tolerate a small amount of ugliness in
your git history in the form of merges which stitch the dgit-
generated archive view into your maintainer history.</p>

<p>This is to handle uploads that were not made with dgit, such as the
uploads you made before switching to this workflow, or NMUs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Benefit from dgit&rsquo;s safety catches.  In particular, ensure that
your upload always matches exactly your git HEAD.</p></li>

<li><p>Provide a better, more detailed history to downstream dgit users.</p></li>

<li><p>Incorporate an NMU with one command.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dgit-maint-merge-7">dgit-maint-merge(7)</h2>

<p>This document describes elements of a workflow for maintaining a non-
native Debian package using dgit.  The workflow makes the following
opinionated assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Git histories should be the non-linear histories produced by
git-merge(1), preserving all information about divergent
development that was later brought together.</p></li>

<li><p>Maintaining convenient and powerful git workflows takes priority
over the usefulness of the raw Debian source package.  The Debian
archive is thought of as an output format.</p>

<p>For example, we don&rsquo;t spend time curating a series of quilt
patches.  However, in straightforward cases, the information such a
series would contain is readily available from dgit-repos.</p></li>

<li><p>It is more important to have the Debian package&rsquo;s git history be a
descendent of upstream&rsquo;s git history than to use exactly the
orig.tar that upstream makes available for download.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This workflow is less suitable for some packages.  When the Debian
delta contains multiple pieces which interact, or which you aren&rsquo;t
going to be able to upstream soon, it might be preferable to maintain
the delta as a rebasing patch series.  For such a workflow see for
example dgit-maint-debrebase(7) and dgit-maint-gbp(7).</p>

<h2 id="dgit-maint-debrebase-7">dgit-maint-debrebase(7)</h2>

<p>This document describes elements of a workflow for maintaining a non-
native Debian package using dgit.  We maintain the Debian delta as a
series of git commits on our master branch.  We use git-debrebase(1) to
shuffle our branch such that this series of git commits appears at the
end of the branch.  All the public git history is fast-forwarding,
i.e., we do not rewrite and force-push.</p>

<p>Some advantages of this workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Manipulate the delta queue using the full power of git-rebase(1),
instead of relying on quilt(1), and without having to switch back
and forth between patches-applied and patches-unapplied branches
when committing changes and trying to build, as with gbp-pq(1).</p></li>

<li><p>If you are using 3.0 (quilt), provide your delta queue as a
properly separated series of quilt patches in the source package
that you upload to the archive (unlike with dgit-maint-merge(7)).</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid the git tree being dirtied by the application or
unapplication of patches, as they are always applied.</p></li>

<li><p>Benefit from dgit&rsquo;s safety catches.  In particular, ensure that
your upload always matches exactly your git HEAD.</p></li>

<li><p>Provide your full git history in a standard format on dgit-repos,
where it can benefit downstream dgit users, such as people using
dgit to do an NMU (see dgit-nmu-simple(7) and dgit-user(7)).</p></li>

<li><p>Minimise the amount you need to know about 3.0 (quilt) in order to
maintain Debian source packages which use that format.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This workflow is appropriate for packages where the Debian delta
contains multiple pieces which interact, or which you don&rsquo;t expect to
be able to upstream soon.  For packages with simple and/or short-lived
Debian deltas, use of git-debrebase(1) introduces unneeded complexity.
For such packages, consider the workflow described in
dgit-maint-merge(7).</p>

<h2 id="dgit-maint-gbp-7">dgit-maint-gbp(7)</h2>

<p>This document explains how dgit can be incorporated into a
git-buildpackage(1) package-maintenance workflow.  This should be read
jointly with git-buildpackage(1)&rsquo;s documentation.  Some reasons why you
might want to incorporate dgit into your existing workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Benefit from dgit&rsquo;s safety catches.  In particular, ensure that
your upload always matches exactly your git HEAD.</p></li>

<li><p>Provide a better, more detailed git history to downstream dgit
users, such as people using dgit to do an NMU (see
dgit-nmu-simple(7) and dgit-user(7)).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that we assume a patches-unapplied repository: the upstream source
committed to the git repository is unpatched.  git-buildpackage(1) can
work with patched-applied repositories, but is normally used with
patches-unapplied.</p>
