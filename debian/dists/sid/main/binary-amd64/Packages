Description: Btrfs Subvolume Snapshot Utility
 "bss" is basically a "btrfs subvolume ..." command wrapper to create and age
 historical snapshots with the intuitive snapshot subvolume name and flexible
 data aging capabilities.
 .
   * check for required free blocks (minimum FMIN %).
   * keep initial few (NMIN) snapshots unconditionally.
   * limit the maximum number of snapshots to NMAX.
   * keep initial snapshots unconditionally for initial time (TMIN).
   * grow time intervals exponentially with the specified ratio (STEP %) up to
     some specified age (TMAX).
   * filter content files of snapshots after the mid point (TMID) of history
     using the script ".bss.fltr" at the BASE directory.
 .
 This can be used to snapshot the root filesystem on btrfs.
   * No requirement to make the root filesystem as subvol=@ or @rootfs.
   * Examples for:
     * Automatic pre and post package installation snapshots of / via APT
       operations on Debian/Ubuntu system.
     * Systemd timer to snapshot on boot and hourly
     * Systemd timer to age snapshots on boot and daily.
