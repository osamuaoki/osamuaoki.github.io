      <description>This is an updated guide. The older deprecated guide was used as its base.
Workstation usability Let me update note on configuring and administrating my workstation under post-Debian Bookworm (12) GNU/Linux in testing.
This is non-hardware specific notes and tips.
For the hardware specific notes and tips, see:
Thinkpad T14 Sony Vaio SVT1313 System installation Initial installation by debian-installer The initial installation by the debian-installer should skip &amp;ldquo;Desktop environment&amp;rdquo; task to make it light GUI-less install.</description>

      <description>Package repo on github page Since Githubs offer nice web site hosting service, I decided to host my private build results there at http://osamuaoki.github.io/debian.
This let me skip running the web server as described in Local private package repo.
Since Debian Salsa runs Gitlab and Gitlab also offers equivalent web site hosting service, one should be able to do the same there. But considering tight resource constaints there, it may not be a good idea to do this on Salsa.</description>

      <description>Backup and snapshot For backup, data needs to be moved to physically separate device. rsync ... is my choice to do this.
For snapshot, data can stay on the same device . btrfs subvolume snapshot ... is my choice to do this.
I created bss script to help me do these easily and its examples contain key parts of the settings. Here are the basic tricks used in them..
Secure backup In order to securely backup private data using non-secure remote storage, data needs to be encrypted.</description>

      <description>Local private package repo After reading https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Setup checking their popularity, I decided to go with reprepro package.
Here, I follow https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/SetupWithReprepro (It was slightly outdated. I update it.)
Setting up an web server $ sudo apt install apache2 Now you can see a nice &amp;ldquo;Default Page&amp;rdquo; at &amp;ldquo;[::1]&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;127.0.0.1&amp;rdquo; for IPV4) using browser.
Let&amp;rsquo;s create a simple directory tree for single distribution case.
$ sudo bash -i # mkdir -p /var/www/html/debian # cat &amp;gt; /etc/apache2/conf-available/repos.</description>

      <description>Development infrastructure In order to keep development setups to be simple and robust, I changed development infrastructure.
For package test build, I decided to move to schroot. For package build, I decided to move to sbuild (a schroot wrapper). For package test for each GUI setups, I decided to set up KVM. (I was suffering sudden cowbuilder failures. That was another motivation.)
Planned infrastructure includes:
APT proxy on the host WS.</description>
