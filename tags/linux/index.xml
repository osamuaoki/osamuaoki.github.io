      <description>Here is a memo over automatic USB backup.&#xA;This is a follow-up of &amp;ldquo;Backup and snapshot&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;(This uses the latest batch and gather subcommand of bss)&#xA;udev(7) under &amp;ldquo;RUN&amp;rdquo; clearly states &amp;ldquo;This can only be used for very short-running foreground tasks.&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;We still see old tips such as Automatic backups with UDEV (2009), which abuse &amp;ldquo;RUN&amp;rdquo; in udev rule to perform backup. These tips shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be followed.&#xA;Under modern system managed by systemd, it seems we need to use its systemd service file with &amp;ldquo;wants&amp;rdquo; mechanism.</description>

      <description>Workstation usability The older deprecated guide was used as the base.&#xA;Considering GNOME post-44 is going through major changes, I still chose to use GNOME 43 in Debian 12 bookworm stable release for my workstation as of 2024-01-04.&#xA;I am trying to keep my workstation as clean bookworm installation as possible.&#xA;This is non-hardware specific notes and tips. For the hardware specific notes and tips, see also:&#xA;Thinkpad T14 Gen 1 &amp;ndash; hostname=goofy Sony Vaio SVT1313 &amp;ndash; hostname=casper hostname=mickey Bare metal initial system installation Initial installation by debian-installer The initial installation by the debian-installer should skip &amp;ldquo;Desktop environment (task-desktop)&amp;rdquo; task and select &amp;ldquo;SSH server (task-ssh-server)&amp;rdquo; to make it light, GUI-less, and SSH-ready.</description>

For package build, I decided to move to sbuild (a schroot wrapper). For package test for each GUI setups, I decided to set up KVM. (I was suffering sudden cowbuilder failures. That was another motivation.)&#xA;Planned infrastructure includes:&#xA;APT proxy on the host WS.</description>
