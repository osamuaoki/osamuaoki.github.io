      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s review a few interesting plugins.
Please note that I manage plugins via Vim 8&amp;rsquo;s native plugin management framework.
Vim general settings (packages) As of 2021-08-27, I mostly use the latest version from github:
 ale securemodelines vim-spell-under (I wrote) vim-better-whitespace vim-indent-guides gnupg (provided by vim-scripts) matchit (provided by vim) fzf and fzf.vim with rg gitgutter vim-python-matchit (I use locally patched 0.5) vim-airline vim-airline-themes  Please note some basic configuration settings including plugin management including ~/.</description>

      <description>I could use Vim as a basic editor with TKL-keyboard while tapping some keys multiple times. This was functional but not so elegant!
I decided to re-learn Vim to use it properly. Here is my learning memo.
For simplicity, I use ^F to mean CTRL-F.
Concept  Use default vim (minimum configuration, if possible).  Use as much native functionalities. Don&amp;rsquo;t force Vim to behave like another program.   50%/60%-keyboard ready.</description>
