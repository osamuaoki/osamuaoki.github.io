      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s review how I initialize Vim and use a few interesting packages.

      <description>I could use Vim as a basic editor with TKL-keyboard while tapping some keys multiple times. This was functional but not so elegant!
I decided to re-learn Vim to use it properly. Here is my learning memo.

Concept  Use default vim (minimum configuration, if possible).  Use as much native functionalities. Don&amp;rsquo;t force Vim to behave like another program.   50%/60%-keyboard ready.</description>
