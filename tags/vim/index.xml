      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s review a few interesting plugins.
Please note that I manage plugins via Vim 8&amp;rsquo;s native plugin management framework.
As of 2021-08-27, I enabled:
 ale vim-airline vim-airline-themes (automatic) vim-better-whitespace vim-indent-guides vim-spell-under  (vim-gitgutter is interesting but I don&amp;rsquo;t work on repo with many contributors.)
Please note some basic configuration settings including plugin management are at ~/.vim/vimrc.
All other initialization code is provided as plugin.
Basic rule: Less customization is better.</description>

      <description>I could use Vim as a basic editor with TKL-keyboard while tapping some keys multiple times. This was functional but not so elegant!
I decided to re-learn Vim to use it properly. Here is my learning memo.
For simplicity, I use ^F to mean CTRL-F.
Concept  Use default vim (minimum configuration, if possible).  Use as much native functionalities. Don&amp;rsquo;t force Vim to behave like another program.   50%/60%-keyboard ready.</description>
