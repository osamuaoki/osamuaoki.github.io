      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s review a few interesting plugins.
Please note that I manage plugins via GUI reconfiguration framework using the vimconf command. See osamuaoki/dot-vim. I admit my scheme is not the main stream one.
Please note very basic configuration is at ~/.vim/vimrc.
All other initialization code is provided as plugin.
osamuaoki/00-vimrc My kitchen sink initialization script.
Map &amp;lt;F2&amp;gt; to toggle PASTE MODE in INSERT MODE Adjust PASTE MODE by F2-key.
set nopaste set pastetoggle=&amp;lt;f2&amp;gt;  Map kj-key sequence to ESC in INSERT MODE Pressing ESC-key to get back to NORMAL MODE from INSERT MODE is a bit stressful since it is far from the finger home position.</description>

      <title>Wayland</title>

      <description>Although the migration from X to wayland is mostly transparent to the end-user like me, there are some exceptions.
How to check if an application uses wayland or X  Execute &amp;ldquo;xeyes &amp;amp;&amp;rdquo; from a terminal console . Move mouse pointer over to an application in question. If eyes are responsive, it&amp;rsquo;s an X application. If eyes aren&amp;rsquo;t responsive, it&amp;rsquo;s a wayland application.  You need to have x11-apps package installed.</description>

      <description>I could use Vim as a basic editor with TKL-keyboard while tapping some keys multiple times. This was functional but not so elegant!
I decided to re-learn Vim to use it properly. Here is my learning memo.
For simplicity, I use ^F to mean CTRL-F.
Concept  Use default vim (minimum configuration, if possible).  Use as much native functionalities. Don&amp;rsquo;t force Vim to behave like another program.  50%/60%-keyboard ready.</description>

      <description>I see formatting consistency provided by the black command helps me.
The black is available as Debian package and its upstream is at https://github.com/psf/black
